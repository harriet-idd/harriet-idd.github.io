						<h4>Program Description</h4>
						<p>Interaction Design and Development is a three-year program at the George Brown School of Design. Interaction Design is an interdisciplinary field that studies various forms of design including user experience, interface development, graphic design and coding fundamentals. Here at George Brown students learn a multitude of skills that will allow them to pursue careers in both front and back end development of digital devices and environments such as websites, mobile devices and wearables.</P>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Year 1</h4>
						<p>In the first year of the program, students are given the basic skills to succeed in the program. Students learn how to use Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, XD, Maya, Atom, Arduino, and Excel. They are taught skills to conceptualize products (wearables, apps, websites, and interactive devices) design interfaces, design logos and icons, create 2D and 3D product shots, create successful information architecture and code in HTML and CSS. In addition the students learn about design culture, studying the history of design and exploring more fields of design than just interaction. design</p>
